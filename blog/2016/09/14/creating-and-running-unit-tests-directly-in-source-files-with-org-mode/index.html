Developing a computer program is not an easy task. The process needs a constant focus. Any interruption of
that process means that time is spent re-focusing on it and errors are more prone to be introduced. The
process involves analyzing a problem to solve by executing a series of steps. It involves writing about the
problem we are trying to solve and writing about the solution we found to solve it. Finally it involves
writing test procedures that can run to make sure that the current state of the implementation of the solution
behaves as expected and that expected behavior is not altered by subsequent modifications.
</p>

<p>
The problem I have been struggling with for the past 19 years — common to all programmers — is that each part
of this development process was performed in a cascade. The tools available, and the methods employed, forced
me to perform each of these steps in isolation and then to iterate how to:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Analyze a problem</li>
<li>Code a solution to the problem</li>
<li>Document the implementation</li>
<li>Create tests for the implementation</li>
<li>If the problem changed, or the solution needed fixing, iterate these same isolated steps from from 1 to 4.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The problem is that keeping the focus, and more importantly having the willpower (literally) to perform each
step under the pressure of deadlines, between meetings, etc., is nearly impossible to do right. Normally the
steps 1 and 2 will be done, but then steps 3 and 4 will be postponed until tomorrow (which never comes…)
</p>

<p>
I don’t think there is any definitive solution to solve this situation. Developing computer programs won’t
ever be an easy task, and focus will always be warranted. However I think there are methodologies and tools
that can be adopted to smooth the process. But one best practice that I think goes quite a bit of the way to
address this problem is to have a single document become the focal point of the overall process.
</p>

<p>
What we want is to be able to perform the process with a single tool and in a single document such that we
only have to focus on it without having to refocus on different tools in different windows all the time during
the development process.
</p>

<p>
In this blog post, I will describe a way to develop, and run, the unit tests (step 4) while keeping the focus
on writing about the solution and implementing it, all in the same (Org-mode) document.
</p>

<p>
Literate programming is many things to many people. I started to write about it on this blog and I will
continue in the coming months. However what I want to do with this blog post is to discuss another important
aspect (at least to me) of Literate Programming, which is that literate programming concepts and principles
leads to create tools (such as Org-mode with Emacs) that help developers to perform the development process in
a single document such that their focus is not distracted.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Unit Testing in Org-mode (for Clojure)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
What I want to show in this blog post is how we can use Org-mode to:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Create a series of unit tests directly where it matters (right below the function to test)</li>
<li>Run the tests when it matters (all the time, while developing or improving the tested function).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Unit tests can be used for a lot of different tasks. The main task is to test the behavior of a function and
to make sure that any future improvements to that function ends up with the expected behavior. But unit tests
can also be used as documentation about all of the ways that a function can be used in code, how their
parameters work and what is expected, etc. Whatever the reason, it is really helpful to have the tests
side-by-side with the function’s code. In most, if not almost all, development environments this is impossible
to get. However, this is really possible with Org-mode and I think this is a really effective way to develop
computer software.
</p>

<p>
Now, let’s figure out how we could properly define unit tests directly into Org-mode files while developing an
application. The goal is to let unit tests be developed at the same time as we develop the code and the
discussions surrounding the code. We shouldn’t have 4 distinct steps: we should do all of them, at the same
time, in the same document. The goal is that all this should happen at the same time such that the focus
doesn’t change all the time.
</p>

<p>
Let’s start with a simple function that gives the factorial of a number n.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-clojure">(defn n!
  [n]
  (loop [x n 
         f 1]
    (if (or (= x 1)
            (= x 0))
      f
      (recur (dec x) (* f x)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now let’s use the function to see what it returns:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-clojure">(n! 10)

3628800
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now let’s define some tests to make sure that this implementation works as expected:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-clojure">(require '[clojure.test :refer :all])

(deftest test-n!-0
  (testing "Testing the n! function for the value 0"
    (is (= 1 (n! 0)))))

(deftest test-n!-1
  (testing "Testing the n! function for the value 1"
    (is (= 1 (n! 1)))))

(deftest test-n!-2
  (testing "Testing the n! function for the value 2"
    (is (= 2 (n! 2)))))

(deftest test-n!-4
  (testing "Testing the n! function for the value 4"
    (is (= 24 (n! 4)))))

(deftest test-n!-5
  (testing "Testing the n! function for the value 5"
    (is (= 120 (n! 5)))))

(deftest test-n!-5-fails
  (testing "Testing the n! function for the value 5 that fails"
    (is (= 121 (n! 5)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then we can run all the tests at once:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-clojure">(run-tests)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
Testing user

FAIL in (test-n!-5-fails) (form-init2702185496610974397.clj:25)
Testing the n! function for the value 5 that fails
expected: (= 121 (n! 5))
  actual: (not (= 121 120))

Ran 6 tests containing 6 assertions.
1 failures, 0 errors.
</pre>

<p>
There are a few things we have to understand regarding how org-mode and clojure work together. When code
blocks are executed directly from a Org-mode document, all of the Clojure code is executed in the namespace
started by Cider, namely the user namespace. When we first define the n! function then it gets defined in the
user namespace, and then when we define the tests, they get defined in that namespace as well. Finally when we
call the run-tests function without any parameter, then it runs the tests from the current namespace, which is
user.
</p>

<p>
This is why it works flawlessly: because each block is executed from the same Clojure namespace; everything
runs from there. If I update that function in the future, I will be able to re-run the tests directly from
that same development context without having to switch to another file or anything.
</p>

<p>
This is really interesting since we can define the functions that compose our application, then we can
immediately start writing the tests to make sure that the function behaves appropriately as expected, and we
can run the tests as often as we want, directly from the same context (development document). Then every time
I save the Org-mode document, then it gets “tangled” into the tests suites that will be normally be run when
the application get compiled, or used in other contexts that requires these tests to run. (Note that “tangle”
is an Org-mode term for generating only the code from an Org-mode document.)
</p>

<p>
What is fantastic with Org-mode is that every time you execute every code block in the document by pressing
C-c C-v b you define the functions and the unit tests in the default namespace, you tangle the code, and you
execute all the code which includes the tests and immediately see, contextually in your work, if any
modifications you made to your code broke some earlier assumptions.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Running One or Multiple Tests</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
It is often the case that you write a function and then want to test it right away. And then you write another
one and test it, too. You will end up with multiple code blocks where you want to test the inner test(s) and
get the results for those only.
</p>

<p>
With clojure.test we are limited in our options: we have run-tests and run-all-tests which provide a summary
report of the executed tests. Since Clojure 1.6 we have access to the test-vars function that we can use to
test one or multiple test cases. However, the usage of that function is a bit complex (in its syntax) and no
reporting is provided except if the tests fails.
</p>

<p>
So what I choose to do is to change this situation by creating a macro that greatly simplifies the code used
to run a specific set of tests and that reports failures and successes.
</p>

<p>
I created a really small and simple application for that purpose called <a href="https://github.com/structureddynamics/org-mode-clj-tests-utils">org-mode-clj-tests-utils</a>. You can
easily use it in your Org-mode document just by making sure that the underlying project uses it.
</p>

<p>
Here is the macro. What it does is simply to take a series of symbols as input and use test-vars to run the
tests and then report failures and successes.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-clojure">(defmacro tests
  "Run one or multiple tests with fixtures. Returns successes or failures. 
   Tests should be in the same namespace."
  [&amp; args]  
  `(binding [clojure.test/*test-out* (java.io.StringWriter.)]
     (clojure.test/test-vars [~@(mapv (fn [tname]
                                        `(var ~tname))
                                      args)])
     (if (empty? (str clojure.test/*test-out*))
       (println "All tests succeeded.")
       (println (str clojure.test/*test-out*)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Another option would be to define the tests in a specific namespace and then to use run-tests on that
namespace only. But that is cumbersome since you would have to use in-ns to define that new namespace and to
revert it back to the default namespace once you are done with the tests.
</p>

<p>
Now let’s see how this new macro can be used. Let’s say we just want to run the test test-n!-0:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-clojure">(tests test-n!-0)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
All tests succeeded.
</pre>

<p>
Then let’s see what it looks like if a test fails:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-clojure">(tests test-n!-5-fails)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
FAIL in (test-n!-5-fails) (form-init2702185496610974397.clj:25)
Testing the n! function for the value 5 that fails
expected: (= 121 (n! 5))
  actual: (not (= 121 120))
</pre>

<p>
Then we can run any number of tests:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-clojure">(tests test-n!-0
       test-n!-1
       test-n!-2
       test-n!-5-fails)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
FAIL in (test-n!-5-fails) (form-init2702185496610974397.clj:25)
Testing the n! function for the value 5 that fails
expected: (= 121 (n! 5))
  actual: (not (= 121 120))
</pre>

<p>
As you can notice, the syntax for calling specific tests has been greatly simplified. We only have a write
tests followed by the name of the tests you want to test in that code block. Then every time you press C-c C-v
b you will re-run every code block of the document and all the results of the tests will be updated.
</p>

<h2 id="orgheadline4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Many people think that Literate Programming is only about typesetting and writing documents as books. However
I think this perception (or at least the general understanding) is wrong. I think the historic context of
Literate Programming influenced that perception but it is really much broader and important (at least to me)
than that. It is about the process of writing computer software, similar to the process of writing books,
articles, blog posts, etc., which includes documentation and testing, more than the task of simply coding.
</p>

<p>
Unit testing is one integral part of this process.
