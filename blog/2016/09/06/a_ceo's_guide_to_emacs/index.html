Years—no, decades—ago, I lived in Emacs. I wrote code and documents, managed email and calendar, and shelled
all in the editor/OS. I was quite happy. Years went by and I moved to newer, shinier things. As a result, I
forgot how to do tasks as basic as efficiently navigating files without a mouse. About three months ago,
noticing just how much of my time was spent switching between applications and computers, I decided to give
Emacs another try. It was a good decision for several reasons that will be covered in this post. Covered too
are .emacs and Dropbox tips so that you can set up a good, movable environment.
</p>

<p>
For those who haven't used Emacs, it's something you'll likely hate, but may love. It's sort of a Rube
Goldberg machine the size of a house that, at first glance, performs all the functions of a toaster. That
hardly sounds like an endorsement, but the key phrase is "at first glance." Once you grok Emacs, you realize
that it's a thermonuclear toaster that can also serve as the engine for&#x2026; well, just about anything you want
to do with text. When you think about how much your computing life revolves around text, this is a rather bold
statement. Bold, but true.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps more importantly to me though, it's the one application I've ever used that makes me feel like I
really own it instead of casting me as an anonymous "user" whose wallet is cleverly targeted by product
marketing departments in fancy offices somewhere near <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zachary-ehren/soma-isnt-a-drug-san-fran_b_987841.html">Soma</a> or Redmond. Modern productivity and authoring
applications (e.g., Pages or IDEs) are like carbon fiber racing bikes. They come kitted out very nicely and
fully assembled. Emacs is like a box of classic <a href="http://www.campagnolo.com/US/en">Campagnolo</a> parts and a beautiful lugged steel frame that's
missing one crank arm and a brake lever that you have to find in some tiny subculture on the Internet. The
first one is faster and complete. The second is a source of endless joy or annoyance depending on your
personality—and will last until your dying day. I'm the sort of person who feels equal joy at finding an old
stash of Campy parts or tweaking my editor with eLisp. YMMV.
</p>

</p>

<p>
This may give the impression that Emacs is anachronistic or old-fashioned. It's not. It's powerful and
timeless, but demands that you patiently understand it on its terms. The terms are pretty far off the beaten
path and seem odd, but there is a logic to them that is both compelling and charming. To me, Emacs feels like
the future rather than the past. Just as the lugged steel frame will be useful and comfortable in decades to
come and the carbon fiber wunderbike will be in a landfill, having shattered on impact, so will Emacs persist
as a useful tool when the latest trendy app is long forgotten.

If the notion of building your own personal working environment by editing Lisp code and having that
fits-like-a-glove environment follow you to any computer is appealing to you, you may really like Emacs. If
you like the new and shiny and want to get straight to work without much investment of time and mental cycles,
it's likely not for you. I don't write code any more (other than Ludwig and Emacs Lisp), but many of the
engineers at Fugue use Emacs to good effect. I'd say our engineers are about 30% Emacs, 40% IDEs, and 30% Vim
users. But, this post is about Emacs for CEOs and other <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/best-pointy-haired-boss-moments-from-dilbert-2013-10">Pointy-Haired Bosses</a> (PHB)^<a href="https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html?hmsr=toutiao.io&amp;utm_medium=toutiao.io&amp;utm_source=toutiao.io#phb">1</a> (and, hey, anyone who’s
curious), so I'm going to explain and/or rationalize why I love it and how I use it. I also hope to provide
you with enough detail that you can have a successful experience with it, without hours of Googling. Included
here is a <a href="https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html?hmsr=toutiao.io&amp;utm_medium=toutiao.io&amp;utm_source=toutiao.io#download">download</a> to my entire environment for you to use, if it suits you.

The long-term advantages that come with using Emacs just make life easier. The net gain makes the initial lift
entirely worthwhile. Consider these:

<h3 id="orgheadline1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> No More Context Switching</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Org Mode alone is worth investing some serious time in, but if you are like me, you are usually working on a
dozen or so documents—from blog posts to lists of what you need to do for a conference to employee reviews. In
the modern world of computing, this generally means using several applications, all of which have distracting
user interfaces and different ways to store, sort, and search. The result is that you need to constantly
switch mental contexts and remember minutiae. I hate context switching because it is an imposition put on me
due to a broken interface model^<a href="https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html?hmsr=toutiao.io&amp;utm_medium=toutiao.io&amp;utm_source=toutiao.io#tufte">2</a> and I hate having to remember things my computer should remember for me in
any rational world. In providing a single environment, Emacs is even more powerful for the PHB than the
programmer, since programmers tend to spend a greater percentage of their day in a single application.
Switching mental contexts has a higher cost than is often apparent. OS and application vendors have tarted up
interfaces to distract us from this reality. If you’re technical, having access to a powerful <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/I/interpreter.html">language</a>
<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/I/interpreter.html">interpreter</a> in a single keyboard shortcut (M-:) is especially useful.^<a href="https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html?hmsr=toutiao.io&amp;utm_medium=toutiao.io&amp;utm_source=toutiao.io#interpreter">3</a>

Many applications can be full screened all day and used to edit text. Emacs is singular because it is both an
editor and a Lisp interpreter. In essence, you have a Turing complete machine a keystroke or two away at all
times, while you go about your business. If you know a little or a lot about programming, you'll recognize
that this means you can do anything in Emacs. The full power of your computer is available to you in near real
time while you work, once you have the commands in memory. You won't want to re-create Excel in eLisp, but
most things you might do in Excel are smaller in scope and easy to accomplish in a line or two of code. If I
need to crunch numbers, I'm more likely to jump over to the scratch buffer and write a little code than open a
spreadsheet. Even if I have an email to write that isn't a one-liner, I'll usually just write it in Emacs and
paste it into my email client. Why context switch when you can just flow? You might start with a simple
calculation or two, but, over time, anything you need computed can be added with relative ease to Emacs. This
is perhaps unique in applications that also provide rich features for creating things for other humans.
Remember those magical terminals in Isaac Asimov's books? Emacs is the closest thing I've encountered to them.
^<a href="https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html?hmsr=toutiao.io&amp;utm_medium=toutiao.io&amp;utm_source=toutiao.io#eww">4</a> I no longer decide what app to use for this or that thing. Instead, I just work. There is real power and
efficiency to having a great tool and committing to it.

<p>
What’s the end result of having the best text editing features I've ever found? Having a community of people
making all manner of useful additions? Having the full power of Lisp a keychord away? It’s that I use Emacs
for all my creative work, aside from making music or images.
</p>

<p>
I have a dual monitor set up at my desk. One of them is in portrait mode with Emacs full screened all day
long. The other one has web browsers for researching and reading; it usually has a terminal open as well. I
keep my calendar, email, etc., on another desktop in OS X, which is hidden while I'm in Emacs, and I keep all
notifications turned off. This allows me to actually concentrate on what I'm doing. I've found eliminating
distractions to be almost impossible in the more modern UI applications due to their efforts to be helpful and
easy to use. I don't need to be constantly reminded how to do operations I've done tens of thousands of times,
but I do need a nice, clean white sheet of paper to be thoughtful. Maybe I'm just bad at living in noisy
environments due to age and abuse, but I’d suggest it’s worth a try for anyone. See what it's like to have
some actual peace and quiet in your computing environment. Of course, lots of apps now have modes that hide
the interface and, thankfully, both Apple and Microsoft now have meaningful full-screen modes. But, no other
application is powerful enough to “live in” for most things. Unless you are writing code all day or perhaps
working on a very long document like a book, you're still going to face the noise of other apps. Also, most
modern applications seem simultaneously patronizing and lacking in functionality and usability.^<a href="https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html?hmsr=toutiao.io&amp;utm_medium=toutiao.io&amp;utm_source=toutiao.io#usability">5</a> The only
applications I dislike more than office apps are the online versions.

But what about communicating? The difference between creating and communicating is substantial. I'm much more
productive at both when I set aside distinct time for each. We use Slack at Fugue, which is both wonderful and
hellish. I keep it on a messaging desktop alongside my calendar and email, so that, while I'm actually making
things, I'm blissfully unaware of all the chatter in the world. It takes just one Slackstorm or an email from
a VC or Board Director to immediately throw me out of my work. But, most things can usually wait an hour or
two.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
The third reason I find Emacs more advantageous than other environments is that it's easy to take all your
stuff with you. By this, I mean that, rather than having a plethora of apps interacting and syncing in their
own ways, all you need is one or two directories syncing via Dropbox or the like. Then, you can have all your
work follow you anywhere in the environment you have crafted to suit your purposes. I do this across OS X,
Windows, and sometimes Linux. It's dead simple and reliable. I've found this capability to be so useful that I
dread dealing with Pages, GDocs, Office, or other kinds of files and applications that force me back into
finding stuff somewhere on the filesystem or in the cloud.
</p>

<p>
The limiting factor in keeping things forever on a computer is file format. Assuming that humans have now
solved the problem of storage ^<a href="https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html?hmsr=toutiao.io&amp;utm_medium=toutiao.io&amp;utm_source=toutiao.io#s3">6</a> for good, the issue we face over time is whether we can continue to access
the information we've created. Text files are the most long-lived format for computing. You easily can open a
text file from 1970 in Emacs. That’s not so true for Office applications. Text files are also nice and
small—radically smaller than Office application data files. As a digital pack rat and as someone who makes
lots of little notes as things pop into my head, having a simple, light, permanent collection of stuff that is
always available is important to me.

The price of all this power and mental peace and quiet is that you have a steep learning curve with Emacs and
it does everything differently than you're used to. At first, this will make you feel like you’re wasting time
on an archaic and strange application that the modern world passed by. It’s a bit like learning to ride a
bicycle^<a href="https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html?hmsr=toutiao.io&amp;utm_medium=toutiao.io&amp;utm_source=toutiao.io#bicycles">7</a> if you've only driven cars.

<h3 id="orgheadline5"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Which Emacs?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
I use the plain vanilla Emacs from GNU for OS X and Windows. You can get the OS X version at <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/"><a href="http://">http://</a></a>
<a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/">emacsformacosx.com/</a> and the Windows version at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/</a></a>. There are a bunch of other
versions out there, especially for the Mac, but I've found the learning curve for doing powerful stuff (which
involves Lisp and lots of modes) to be much lower with the real deal. So download it, and we can get started!^
<a href="https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html?hmsr=toutiao.io&amp;utm_medium=toutiao.io&amp;utm_source=toutiao.io#nottutorial">8</a> Also, download my entire environment with <a href="https://blog.fugue.co/assets/attachments/josh-emacs.tgz">this tarball</a>. When you open the tarball, you'll get an .emacs.d
folder and an .emacs file. Because these both start with a period, they are hidden files on *nix. You’ll have
to use a terminal to see them on *nix. Or, set your Finder or other GUI to show hidden files. (We’re not
pranking you.)

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline6"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> First, You'll Need To Learn How To Navigate</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
I use the Emacs conventions for keys and combinations in this document. These are 'C' for control, 'M' for
meta (which is usually mapped to Alt or Option), and the hyphen for holding down the keys in combination. So
C-h t means to hold down control and type h, then release control and type t. This is the command for bringing
up the tutorial, which you should go ahead and do.
</p>

<p>
Don't use the arrow keys or the mouse. They work, but you should give yourself a week of using the native
navigation commands in Emacs. Once you have them committed to muscle memory, you'll likely enjoy them and miss
them badly everywhere else you go. The Emacs tutorial does a pretty good job of walking you through them, but
I'll summarize so you don't need to read the whole thing. The boring stuff is that, instead of arrows, you use
C-b for back, C-f for forward, C-p for previous (up), and C-n for next (down). You may be thinking "why in the
world would I do that, when I have perfectly good arrow keys?" There are several reasons. First, you don't
have to move your hands from the typing position, and the forward and back keys used with Alt (or Meta in
Emacspeak) navigate a word at a time. This is more handy than is obvious. The third good reason is that, if
you want to repeat a command, you can precede it with a number. I often use this when editing documents by
estimating how many words I need to go back or lines up or down and doing something like C-9 C-p or M-5 M-b.
The other really important navigation commands are based on a for the beginning of a thing and e for the end
of a thing. Using C-a|e are on lines, and using M-a|e, are on sentences. For the sentence commands to work
properly, you'll need to double space after periods, which simultaneously provides a useful feature and takes
a shibboleth of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/29/two-spaces-after-period-debate_n_7455660.html">opinion</a> off the mental table. If you need to export the document to a single space <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/one-space-between-sentences.html">publication</a>
<a href="http://practicaltypography.com/one-space-between-sentences.html">environment</a>, you can write a macro in moments to do so.
</p>

<p>
It genuinely is worth going through the tutorial that ships with Emacs. I'll cover a few important commands
for the truly impatient, but the tutorial is gold. Reminder: C-h t for the tutorial.

<h3 id="orgheadline7"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Learn To Copy and Paste</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
You can put Emacs into CUA mode, which will work in familiar ways, but the native Emacs way is pretty great
and plenty easy once you learn it. You mark regions (like selecting) by using Shift with the navigation
commands. So C-F selects one character forward from the cursor, etc. You copy with M-w, you cut with C-w, and
you paste with C-y. These are actually called killing and yanking, but it's very similar to cut and paste.
There is magic under the hood here in the kill ring, but for now, just worry about cut, copy, and paste. If
you start fumbling around at this point, C-x u is undo&#x2026;

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline8"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> Next, Learn Ido Mode</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
Trust me. Ido makes working with files much easier. You don't generally use a separate Finder|Explorer window
to work with files in Emacs. Instead you use the editor's commands to create, open, and save files. This is a
bit of a pain without Ido, so I recommend installing it before learning the other way. Ido comes with Emacs
beginning with version 22, but you'll want to make some tweaks to your .emacs file so that it is always used.
This is a good excuse to get your environment set up.
</p>

<p>
Most features in Emacs come in modes. To install any given mode, you'll need to do two things. Well, at first
you'll need to do a few extra things, but these only need to be done once, and thereafter only two things. So
the extra things are that you'll need a single place to put all your eLisp files and you'll need to tell Emacs
where that place is. I suggest you make a single directory in, say, Dropbox that is your Emacs home. Inside
this, you'll want to create an .emacs file and an .emacs.d directory. Inside the .emacs.d, make a directory
called lisp. So you should have:
</p>

<pre class="example">
home
|
+.emacs
|
-.emacs.d
  |
  -lisp
</pre>

<p>
You'll put the .el files for things like modes into the home/.emacs.d/lisp directory, and you'll point to that
in your .emacs like so:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span style="color: #4f97d7;">(</span>add-to-list 'load-path <span style="color: #2d9574;">"~/.emacs.d/lisp/"</span><span style="color: #4f97d7;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Ido Mode comes with Emacs, so you won't need to put an .el file into your Lisp directory for this, but you'll
be adding other stuff soon that will go in there.

<p>
But wait, that says that .emacs and .emacs.d are in your home directory, and we put them in some dumb folder
in Dropbox! Correct. This is how you make it easy to have your environment anywhere you go. Keep everything in
Dropbox and make symbolic links to .emacs, .emacs.d, and your main document directories in ~. On OS X, this is
super easy with the ln -s command, but on Windows this is a pain. Fortunately, Emacs provides an easy
alternative to symlinking on Windows, the HOME environment variable. Go into Environment Variables in Windows
(as of Windows 10, you can just hit the Windows key and type "Environment Variables" to find this with search,
which is the best part of Windows 10), and make a HOME environment variable in your account that points to the
Dropbox folder you made for Emacs. If you want to make it easy to navigate to local files that aren't in
Dropbox, you may instead want to make a symbolic link to the Dropbox Emacs home in your actual home directory.
</p>

<p>
So now you've done all the jiggery-pokery needed to get any machine pointed to your Emacs setup and files. If
you get a new computer or use someone else's for an hour or a day, you get your entire work environment. This
seems a little difficult the first time you do it, but it's about a ten minute (at most) operation once you
know what you're doing.

<p>
But we were configuring Ido&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
<code>C-x C-f</code> and type <code>~/.emacs RET RET</code> to create your <code>.emacs</code> file. Add these lines to it:

With the .emacs buffer open, do an M-x evaluate-buffer command, and you'll either get an error if you munged
something or you'll get Ido. Ido changes how the minibuffer works when doing file operations. There is great
documentation on it, but I'll point out a few tips. Use the ~/ effectively; you can just type ~/ at any point
in the minibuffer and it'll jump back to home. Implicit in this is that you should have most of your stuff a
short hop off your home. I use ~/org for all my non-code stuff and ~/code for code. Once you’re in the right
directory, you'll often have a collection of files with different extensions, especially if you use Org Mode
and publish from it. You can type period and the extension you want no matter where you are in the file name
and Ido will limit the choices to files with that extension. For example, I'm writing this blog post in Org
Mode, so the main file is: <code>~/org/blog/emacs.org</code>
</p>

<p>
I also occasionally push it out to HTML using Org Mode publishing, so I've got an emacs.html file in the same
directory. When I want to open the Org file, I will type: <code>C-x C-f ~/o[RET]/bl[RET].or[RET]</code>
</p>

<p>
The [RET]s are me hitting return for auto completion for Ido Mode. So, that’s 12 characters typed and, if
you're used to it, a lot less time than opening Finder|Explorer and clicking around. Ido Mode is plenty
useful, but really is a utility mode for operating Emacs. Let's explore some modes that are useful for getting
work done.

<h3 id="orgheadline10"><span class="section-number-3">2.6</span> Fonts and Styles</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">
<p>
I recommend getting the excellent input family of typefaces for use in Emacs. They are customizable with
different braces, zeroes, and other characters. You can build in extra line spacing into the font files
themselves. I recommend a 1.5X line spacing and using their excellent proportional fonts for code and data. I
use Input Serif for my writing, which has a funky but modern feel. You can find them on <a href="http://input.fontbureau.com/"><a href="http://">http://</a></a>
<a href="http://input.fontbureau.com/">input.fontbureau.com/</a> where you can customize to your preferences. You can manually set the fonts using menus
in Emacs, but this puts code into your .emacs file and, if you use multiple devices, you may find you want
some different settings. I've set up my .emacs to look for the machine I'm using by name and configure the
screen appropriately. The code for this is:

<p>
You should replace the system-name values with what you get when you evaluate (system-name) in your copy of
Emacs. Note that on Sampo (my MacBook), I also set Emacs to full screen. I'd like to do this on Windows as
well, but Windows and Emacs don't really love each other and it always ends up in some wonky state when I try
this. Instead, I just fullscreen it manually after launch.
</p>

<p>
I also recommend getting rid of the awful toolbar that Emacs got sometime in the 90s when the cool thing to do
was to have toolbars in your application. I also got rid of some other "chrome" so that I have a simple,
productive interface. Add these to your .emacs file to get rid of the toolbar and scroll bars, but to keep
your menu available (on OS X, it'll be hidden unless you mouse to the top of the screen anyway):

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline11" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline11"><span class="section-number-3">2.7</span> Org Mode</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-7">
<p>
I pretty much live in Org Mode. It is my go-to environment for authoring documents, keeping notes, making
to-do lists and 90% of everything else I do. Org was originally conceived as a combination note-taking and
to-do list utility by a fellow who is a laptop-in-meetings sort. I am against use of laptops in meetings and
don't do it myself, so my use cases are a little different than his. For me, Org is primarily a way to handle
all manner of content within a structure. There are heads and subheads, etc., in Org Mode, and they function
like an outline. Org allows you to expand or hide the contents of the tree and also to rearrange the tree.
This fits how I think very nicely and I find it to be just a pleasure to use in this way.
</p>

<p>
Org Mode also has a lot of little things that make life pleasant. For example, the footnote handling is
excellent and the LaTeX/PDF output is great. Org has the ability to generate agendas based on the to-do's in
all your documents and a nice way to relate them to dates/times. I don't use this for any sort of external
commitments, which are handled on a shared calendar, but for creating things and keeping track of what I need
to create in the future, it's invaluable. Installing it is as easy as adding the org-mode.el to your Lisp
directory and adding these lines to your .emacs, if you want it to indent based on tree location and to open
documents fully expanded:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span style="color: #2aa1ae; background-color: #292e34;">;; </span><span style="color: #2aa1ae; background-color: #292e34;">set up org mode</span>
<span style="color: #4f97d7;">(</span><span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> org-startup-indented t<span style="color: #4f97d7;">)</span>
<span style="color: #4f97d7;">(</span><span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> org-startup-folded <span style="color: #2d9574;">"showall"</span><span style="color: #4f97d7;">)</span>
<span style="color: #4f97d7;">(</span><span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> org-directory <span style="color: #2d9574;">"~/org"</span><span style="color: #4f97d7;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The last line is there so that Org knows where to look for files to include in agendas and some other things.
I keep Org right in my home directory, i.e., a symlink to the directory that lives in Dropbox, as described
earlier.
</p>

<p>
I have a stuff.org file that is always open in a buffer. I use it like a notepad. Org makes it easy to extract
things like TODOs and stuff with deadlines. It's especially useful when you can inline Lisp code and evaluate
it whenever you need. Having code with content is super handy. Again, you have access to the actual computer
with Emacs, and this is a liberation.

<h3 id="orgheadline12"><span class="section-number-3">2.8</span> Publishing with Org Mode</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-8">
<p>
I care about the appearance and formatting of my documents. I started my career as a designer, and I think
information can and should be presented clearly and beautifully. Org has great support for generating PDFs via
LaTeX, which has a bit of its own learning curve, but doing simple things is pretty easy.
</p>

<p>
If you want to use fonts and styles other than the typical LaTeX ones, you've got a few things to do. First,
you'll want XeLaTeX so you can use normal system fonts rather than LaTeX specific fonts. Next, you'll want to
add this to .emacs:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span style="color: #4f97d7;">(</span><span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> org-latex-pdf-process
      '<span style="color: #bc6ec5;">(</span><span style="color: #2d9574;">"xelatex -interaction nonstopmode %f"</span>
        <span style="color: #2d9574;">"xelatex -interaction nonstopmode %f"</span><span style="color: #bc6ec5;">)</span><span style="color: #4f97d7;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I put this right at the end of my Org section of .emacs to keep things tidy. This will allow you to use more
formatting options when publishing from Org. For example, I often use:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-org"><span style="color: #9f8766;">#+LaTeX_HEADER: \usepackage{fontspec}</span>
<span style="color: #9f8766;">#+LATEX_HEADER: \setmonofont[Scale=0.9]{Input Mono}</span>
<span style="color: #9f8766;">#+LATEX_HEADER: \setromanfont{Maison Neue}</span>
<span style="color: #9f8766;">#+LATEX_HEADER: \linespread{1.5}</span>
<span style="color: #9f8766;">#+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[margin=1.25in]{geometry}</span>

<span style="color: #9f8766;">#+TITLE:</span> <span style="color: #bc6ec5; font-size: 140%; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Document Title Here</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
These simply go somewhere in your .org file. Our corporate font for body copy is Maison Neue, but you can put
whatever is appropriate here. I strongly discourage the use of Maison Neue. It’s a terrible font and no one
should ever use it.
</p>

<p>
This file is an example of PDF output using these settings. This is what out-of-the-box LaTeX always looks
like. It's fine I suppose, but the fonts are boring and a little odd. Also, if you use the standard format,
people will assume they are reading something that is or pretends to be an academic paper. You've been warned.

want to jump to. It highlights all occurrences of words with that initial character, replacing it with a
letter of the alphabet. You simply type the letter of the alphabet for the location you want and your cursor
jumps to it. I find myself using this as often as the more typical nav keys or search. Download the .el to

That's enough for one post—this may get you somewhere you'd like to be. I'd love to hear about your uses for
Emacs aside from programming (or for programming!) and whether this was useful at all. There are likely some
boneheaded PHBisms in how I use Emacs, and if you want to point them out, I'd appreciate it. I'll probably
write some updates over time to introduce additional features or modes. I'll certainly show you how to use
Fugue with Emacs and Ludwig-mode as we evolve it into something more useful than code highlighting. Send your
thoughts to <a href="https://twitter.com/fugueHQ">@fugueHQ</a> on Twitter.
