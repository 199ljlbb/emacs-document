One little-know feature of [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] is that you can define new types of links
with the aptly named [[http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/org-add-link-type][org-add-link-type]]. The applications of this virtue are
many. One might, for instance, write links which search an entire code base
for an expression.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-add-link-type
   "grep" 'endless/follow-grep-link)

  (defun endless/follow-grep-link (regexp)
    "Run `rgrep' with REGEXP as argument."
    (grep-compute-defaults)
    (rgrep regexp "*" (expand-file-name "./")))
#+END_SRC

Then, when you click on something like the following link in an org-mode
buffer, you'll be taken to a list of results.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,** TODO Refactor [[grep:OldClassName][OldClassName]] into NewClassName 
#+END_SRC

* LINK header arguments

As [[http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/2d6hjs/use_orgmode_links_for_absolutely_anything/cjmyxfm][/u/blue1_ points out]], for links that are simple URL substitutions you can
also use #+LINK headers.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+LINK: isbn http://www.amazon.com/dp/%s
#+END_SRC

* Tag Searches

For another use case, the following code defines links which search your
headlines for specific tags.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  (org-add-link-type
   "tag" 'endless/follow-tag-link)

  (defun endless/follow-tag-link (tag)
    "Display a list of TODO headlines with tag TAG.
  With prefix argument, also display headlines without a TODO keyword."
    (org-tags-view (null current-prefix-arg) tag))
#+END_SRC

Then, merely write your links as

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  [[tag:work+phonenumber-boss][Optional Description]]
#+END_SRC

The syntax allowed, [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Matching-tags-and-properties.html#Match-syntax][described here]], is the same used for the [[http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/org-tags-view][org-tags-view]]
command.
