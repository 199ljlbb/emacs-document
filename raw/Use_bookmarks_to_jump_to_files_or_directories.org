In Emacs you can [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Bookmarks.html][bookmark]] files and directories (and lots of other things) so that you can quickly jump to
them (similar to a browser’s bookmarks).

The basics are easy. Use C-x r m to make a bookmark to the file or directory you are currently visiting.
You’ll be prompted for an optional name for your bookmark. For example, I use names starting dir- for
bookmarks to directories so that they all appear together in the bookmark list.

You can use C-x r b to go to a bookmark, and you’ll prompted for the name of the bookmark. Use C-x r l to list
all of the bookmarks.

There is a [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BookmarkPlus][bookmarks+]] package which adds extra features to the normal bookmarks, but I’ve not found that I
need those extras so far.
