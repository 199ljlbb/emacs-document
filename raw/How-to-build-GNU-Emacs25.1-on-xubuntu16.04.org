Now that GNU Emacs 25.1 has been released, it is time for my customary “how to
install Emacs 25.1 on a recent Ubuntu” post. In my case I’m using XUbuntu
16.04, but the instructions are pretty much the same for just about every
recent Ubuntu version. The package versions of the referenced packages differ,
but the package names haven’t changed since I first published one of these
posts.

I make sure that the build-essential package is installed, plus to make things
easier I’m also installing the build dependencies for Emacs 24. That way the
Emacs 25.1 build should have the same options enabled as the official Emacs 24
package you get with Ubuntu.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo apt install build-essential
  sudo apt-get build-dep emacs24
#+END_SRC

I already had build-essential installed, but not the build dependencies. Don’t
be surprised if apt-get wants to install a fair number of packages as build
dependencies – it installed 171 new packages on my machine.

At the same time, you want to download the Emacs sources via the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html][Emacs]]
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html][download page]] and untar it into a convenient directory. Then it’s simply a
matter of running ./configure and kicking off the build:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local
  make && make install
#+END_SRC

I prefer to install my home-built Emacsen and other binaries into a directory
tree that’s user local, hence the –prefix above. That way, I don’t run into
conflicts with system packages.

That’s it, a quick check that we have a working version of Emacs 25.1 and
we’re in business:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ~/local/bin/emacs --version
  # GNU Emacs 25.1.1

  # You may redistribute copies of GNU Emacs
  # under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
  # For more information about these matters, see the file named COPYING.
#+END_SRC

Of course I also have the GUI version for the time when I’m not ssh’d into a
remote server:

Happy Emacsing! I’m off to check out the new features in Emacs 25.
