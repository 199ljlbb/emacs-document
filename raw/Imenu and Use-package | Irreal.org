A couple of years ago, I wrote about [[http://irreal.org/blog/?p=3979][Jordon Biondo’s gist]] that allowed imenu
to locate use-package blocks in your .emacs or init.el files. It’s really
useful and I recommended it to everyone who spent any time editing their Emacs
configuration.

Today, [[http://irreal.org/blog/?p=3979#comment-3140572899][Fran Burstall]] commented that use-package now has built in support for
this. All you need to do is set use-package-enable-imenu-support non-nil
before use-package is loaded. The code looks very similar to Biondo’s gist
except that it works for both use-package and require. Burstall isn’t sure
when the capability was added and I can’t tell from the code. All I can tell
you for sure is that it’s in the current version (2.3).
