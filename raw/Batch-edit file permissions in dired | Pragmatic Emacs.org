I’ve written before about using the editing features in dired (AKA wdired) to
do neat things like [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/dired-redirect-symbolic-links/][redirect symlinks]]. I recently discovered that by adding
the following option to your [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/editing-your-emacs-config-file/][emacs config file]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; allow editing file permissions
  (setq wdired-allow-to-change-permissions t)
#+END_SRC

then you can also edit the file permissions directly in the dired buffer.

Here’s a quick animated example where I want to set group write permissions
for all the pdf files in a particular directory. I use several tools to make
this really easy:

 1. I used [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/dynamically-filter-directory-listing-with-dired-narrow/][dired-narrow]] to filter the view down to just the pdf files
 2. I use C-x C-q to make the dired buffer editable
 3. I move to the group write permission spot on the first line and then use 
    [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/multiple-cursors/][multiple cursors]] to add a cursor for each line
 4. I hit w to set the write permission, RET to quit multiple cursors, and C-c
    C-c to make the change permanent
