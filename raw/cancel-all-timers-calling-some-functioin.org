This is a bit of a niche post but I recently found I had accidentally started
a bunch of duplicate timers all running the same function. I hadn’t recorded
the timer objects for them so couldn’t use cancel-timer to kill them. After a
bit of searching I discovered the function cancel-function-timers which will
cancel all timers that call a particular function.

Not something you’ll be using every day, but might be useful one day!
