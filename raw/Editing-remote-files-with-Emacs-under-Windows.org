Recently I had the need to edit remote files under Windows 10, and I used one of my favourite editors, which
is emacs. In order to accomplish this, I only had to include these lines on the emacs init.el configuration
file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'tramp)
  (set-default 'tramp-auto-save-directory "C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp")
  (set-default 'tramp-default-method "plink")
#+END_SRC

Replace <username> with your Windows user.

Don’t forget to check that the environmet variable %Path% contains the folder where plink.exe is.

After reloading the init.el configuration file using the command: =M-x load-file=

then pressing return twice to accept the default filename, I could now edit remote files using the command to
open a file: =C-x C-f=

and specify the connection string: =/<remote username>@<remote host>:=

then pressing return and entering the remote username password. Et voilá!

Until next time, have a lot of coding fun!
