I recently needed to transpose a table in org-mode and spent a few minutes trying to come up with a keyboard
macro to do it before it occurred to me that there might be a command to do this already. And of course there
was: M-x org-table-transpose-table-at-point. Here it is in action:

It’s great when there’s a command that does exactly what you want!
