One neat feature of [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html][org-mode agenda]] is ability to display appointments in
Emacs calendar. Sadly, this isn't obvious nor enabled by default - I
discovered it accidentally by browsing through Emacs themes screenshots.

In screenshot below, you can see highlighted days with planned meetings and
scheduled work in my calendar.

Setup is very easy. First, set calendar-mark-diary-entries-flag with:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq calendar-mark-diary-entries-flag t)
#+END_SRC

Then create $HOME/diary file, if not present, and add this line:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  %%(org-diary)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now in Emacs, open agenda view with (org-agenda) and open calendar with c; you
will get highlighted all important dates. Alternatively, calling

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  M-x calendar
#+END_EXAMPLE

will essentially do the same (open calendar) with fewer strokes.

Reverse action will also work - to see what is scheduled for particular
highlighted day, just point cursor to that day and hit key c - Emacs will open
org-mode agenda view and place cursor under correct entry.

* Using with appointments (appt)

In case you use org-mode with [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2007/11/setting-up-appointment-reminders-in-org/][appointments]] to get visual reminders, be aware
that calling (appt-activate 1) will run diary and making this call in your
Emacs configuration will display diary window at Emacs startup, which I didn't
like. To circumvent this behavior, appt-display-diary variable should be used.

In short, my appointments setup looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-finalize-agenda-hook
            (lambda ()
              (setq appt-message-warning-time 10        ;; warn 10 min in advance
                    appt-display-diary nil              ;; do not display diary when (appt-activate) is called
                    appt-display-mode-line t            ;; show in the modeline
                    appt-display-format 'window         ;; display notification in window
                    calendar-mark-diary-entries-flag t) ;; mark diary entries in calendar
              (org-agenda-to-appt)                      ;; copy all agenda schedule to appointments
              (appt-activate 1)))                       ;; active appt (appointment notification)
#+END_SRC
