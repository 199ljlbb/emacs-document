* [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23621786/how-to-input-password-when-evaluate-code-block-in-emacs-org-mode][How to input password when evaluate code block in Emacs org-mode?]]

               I have a shell code block in Org file. And there's "sudo" command in it. So I should be asked  
               to key in password. But when I evaluate it, it just return error for "sudo" command. Is it     
               there's any way to make the evaluation kind of interactive?

Yes, there is, by adding appropriate [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Code-block-specific-header-arguments.html#Code-block-specific-header-arguments][header arguments]] to the #+BEGIN_SRC line:                    
                                                                                                              
#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /sudo::                                                                       
    apt-get update                                                                                    
  ,#+END_SRC                                                                                         
#+END_SRC
                                                                                                              
Source: [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2013-02/msg00354.html][Running a sudo in a #+begin_src sh fails to get tty and askpass]] on the emacs-orgmode      
mailing list.                                                                                     
                                                                                                              
Explanation: The [[http://orgmode.org/manual/dir.html#dir][:dir]] argument                                                                    
                                                                                                              
specifies the default directory during code block execution. If it is absent, then the        
directory associated with the current buffer is used.                                         
                                                                                                              
By passing /sudo:: as a value to :dir we are making use of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][TRAMP]] syntax for accessing files or    
directories with superuser privileges. Note that in the example above we are not specifying a     
directory to use after ::. In this case, /root will be used as a default. So essentially, what we 
are saying to [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Org Babel]] is "Access /root as root and use that location as the default directory   
when executing this code".                                                                        
                                                                                                              
You can specify a different directory to use by changing /sudo:: to                               
                                                                                                              
/sudo::/path/to/dir                                                                               
                                                                                                              
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                                              
EDIT                                                                                              
                                                                                                              
If you need some commands in the code block to run without superuser privileges, you can do so by 
putting                                                                                           
                                                                                                              
sudo -u <username>                                                                                
                                                                                                              
in front of them (replacing <username> with the user name of a regular user). For illustration    
purposes, let's say your user name is enchanter, and you want any commands in your code block that
don't require superuser privileges to be run as your own user. In this case, you would have to    
prefix each of these commands with                                                                
                                                                                                              
sudo -u enchanter                                                                                 
                                                                                                              
You can check that this works using whoami (which prints the name of the user that is currently   
"active"). Add

I am sure there are other posts on StackExchange/The Internet addressing the issue of running

The answer from @itsjeyd is good when you have most commands to run as SUDO.                      
                                                                                                              
But when you only have a small portion commands to run as SUDO, you have to code a lot of sudo -u 
<username> and you have to pass user name as variable if you want that block can be run by users. 
                                                                                                              
For that case, I have a solution to use echo <password> | sudo -S <your command>                  
                                                                                                              
Here is the example:                                                                              
                                                                                                              
#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC sh :var PASSWORD=(read-passwd "Sudo Password: ")                                      
    # some normal commands here and there

    # run sudo
    echo ${PASSWORD} | sudo -S <your command>

    # more normal commands
  ,#+END_SRC                                                                                         
#+END_SRC
