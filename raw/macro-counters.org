I’ve [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/naming-and-saving-macros-for-repetitive-tasks/][posted]] about using keyboard macros to record and play back repetitive tasks. Macros include a 
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macro-Counter.html][counter]] which lets you insert numerical values that increment each time the macro is called.

For example, go to a new line and start a macro with C-x ( and then hit C-a to move to the start of
the line, C-x C-k C-i to insert the macro counter (initially zero) and then RET to go to a new line
and C-x ) to stop the recording. Run the macro a few times with C-x e and then just e to repeat the
macro and you’ll get something like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  0
  1
  2
  3
  4
#+END_EXAMPLE

The counter starts at zero every time you define a new macro. To set it to another value, use C-x C-k
C-c before defining or invoking a macro.
