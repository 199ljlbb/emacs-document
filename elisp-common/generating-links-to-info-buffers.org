When writing an email about Emacs, e.g. on the help-gnu-emacs mailing list, I
often want to include a link to an Info node. It is easy in Org-mode, where
you can use org-store-link (however, by default, the link does not export
“properly” to HTML, though, i.e., you don’t get the link to the online Emacs
manual) and then org-insert-link. But even if you don’t use Org-mode, there is
a nice trick: you can press c in any info buffer to copy the “link” (i.e., the
current node name) to the kill buffer. Then, you can write

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (info "<yank here>")
#+END_SRC

in your email, and tell the recipient to position the point after that form
and press C-x C-e. (In case s?he does not use Emacs to read mail, s?he will
have to copy it to =*scratch*= or somewhere first, of course.)
